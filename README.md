# form-validation
Contact forms are a common interaction pattern and a great way to practice form creation skills because they typically include a variety of input fields, some of which are required for submission and some of which are optional. I also included fields that are common in other types of forms, such as checkboxes, which are frequently used to agree to sign up for things, in this contact form.

I validated input using both built-in validation and the Constraints Validation API.
